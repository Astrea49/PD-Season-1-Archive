                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kataoka had locked himself shut in his room, scared shitless of the prospect of people killing each other. Initially, he took it as a joke as did a lot of people there. I mean, such a thing being thrown at you all of a sudden as soon as you wake up, how can you not take it as a joke?

He replayed the particular scene he witnessed last time in his head, frantically shaking his head afterwards to try and erase that memory. But it stuck to him regardless of what he did. He shut his eyes and brought his knees closer to his face, rocking back and forth on his bed. Kataoka tried to calm himself down. He can&#39;t stay a whiny little pissant that rejects the situation he&#39;s in forever. He has to learn to adapt to it and find out what was going on.

<em>This doesn&#39;t even...concern me to begin with...</em> He thought to himself.

He breathed a sigh, calming himself down so he could process his thoughts in an orderly fashion. Eventually, he got a hold of himself and decided to look around his room for the time being. There wasn&#39;t anything grand or unordinary within that small box, a typical dorm room, he concluded. He checked the drawers, finding a simple notebook inside.

He glanced around his room briefly before setting his gaze back on the notebook. He riffled through the many pages for any possible clues that were hidden away but to no avail. It was empty.

<em>That&#39;s disappointing. Then is this for me..?</em>

<em>I wonder if everyone else has this too..</em>

He pushed the drawer back and pulled the chair out of the desk. He sat down comfortably before pulling it a bit closer to the desk. He placed the notebook in front of him and with a pencil in hand, he began to document his thoughts.

Once he was done with that, he stretched his body briefly before rising up lackadaisically and then throwing himself on the bed, ending the day for him.</span>

He heard a soft voice echoing in his head. He wasn&#39;t sure who it belonged to or what it was calling but it stirred him awake. His eyes fluttered open, greeted with the ceiling of his new &#39;prison&#39;.

<em>...Right...</em>

He sat up on his bed and did a bit of light stretching before glancing around the room until his eyes landed on his desk, which had an open notebook with a pencil right next to it.

Seeing this made him remember what he wrote in his last journal entry.

&quot;Right. Let&#39;s get on with this.&quot;

He got up and left his room, eager to explore this tower.</span>

Hearing the announcement reminded him that itd been about 3-4 days since they were trapped in this wretched tower. At this point, he figured that he was getting used to it but in reality, he was still finding all of this difficult to believe. I mean, how can anyone get used to this? The threat of death is constant and you never know who to trust.

That being said, he still chose to open himself up to other people. Namely, to Manami. That was the silver lining in all of this. He managed to make a friend and not just anyone, an Ultimate. He felt somewhat accomplished that he was able to do so, digging into his pocket and pulling out the ring he gave him. Looking at it was kind of reassuring, that there still might be some kind of hope in all of this. He stood up from the edge of his bed and headed out.

What a great start to his day!</span>

Well, questions for later. For now, he had to fulfill that quota he set himself on yesterday.

He needed to meet Fleming sometime later for some questioning but for now that&#39;ll wait. Still a long day ahead of him, so he might as well fill it up with some exploring. With that objective in mind, he left his room after some light stretching.</span>

He could feel it in his body. Something was holding him back from sleeping and he was wondering what the hell it could be. Regardless, he cant exactly gain the energy he lost but he can try to prolong it by eating something so he lazily made his way out of his room for a quick bite.</span>

All he did was just cup his hand and splash some water on his face to try and keep himself awake somehow. It did help out but it wasn&#39;t exactly that effective. If anything, it just made his face all wet. Amidst all of this, a realization struck him.

<em>Oh yeah. Isn&#39;t this like my first time letting a girl into my room. Well, didn&#39;t think it&#39;d happen here of all places. Well, first time for everything I suppose.</em> He looked into the mirror before him, noticing his face was worse than the first time he got out of this room.

<em>What&#39;s the big deal with this anyways. Like, people get all shy over this? It doesn&#39;t feel anything but <strong>dull</strong>.</em> He sighed, hanging his head while setting his hands on each end of the sink to hold himself up.

She stayed quiet as he walked into the bathroom, it&#39;s not like she could really speak up much or say anything about it, and it would be incredibly rude to just intrude on someone when they&#39;re there, so she just kept her mouth shut and sat down on the floor.

Itd been a quite a few hours or so since he&#39;s been awake and the only thing in his head right now is how much he wanted to sleep. But alas, he pressed on, shuffling over to the edge of the bed before sitting upright.

&quot;If I have to be honest, this rooms much better than the one I have back home. Though, I have a lot of stuff there so this doesn&#39;t even compare... What about yours? What does it look like..?&quot;</span>

&quot;What&#39;s wrong...? Is it embarrassing to talk about...?&quot;  He didn&#39;t really point out anything, just the fact that she seemed to stutter a lot when it came down to this.

Im pretty alright when it comes to school subjects, not the best of the bunch but Im far from being the worst... Just enough to get by, yknow?&quot;

He leaned back, placing his hands behind him to prop himself up. &quot;Even so, its hard to pick a career path since Im not really sure what I want to do with my life...&quot;

&quot;The thing about some Ultimates is that some have talents that&#39;ll have them set for life. Some are just, well, simple titles that indicate that they are the very best at something.. Im not sure where yours land. Its right inside that grey area that&#39;s between the two...&quot; He then got back to laying face up on his bed.

&quot;It&#39;d be nice... To have a talent like that...&quot; His eyes were halfway closed at this point but even if theyre completely shut, he probably won&#39;t wander off and sleep. Though, its his situation. As far as he was concerned, he was just the average person so he does all he can to work his way up. Its clear he&#39;s quite envious of those with the kind of talent he spoke of, as they have their career path right in front of them as opposed to him, being unsure of what he wants.

&quot;One things for sure, books serve their purpose very nicely. Anyone can pick it up and anyone can learn from it. What makes people different in that regard is their willingness and effort, I guess.&quot; <em>God, there I go saying something corny.</em></span>

Normally, she looked pretty dead and lifeless for some reason but this time, she seemed brimming with life and vigor. He responded with a smile of his own before saying, &quot;Thanks. Thats very kind of you.&quot;

When she suggested that she would teach him how to knit, he felt cheery all of a sudden as he slowly brought himself up, &quot;Hoho, you sure...~?

&quot;I like to think that they do so because they want to be able to remember the things theyve talk about considering their poor memory. So, they feel the need to say it multiple times because its like clinging onto a rope of some kind. They don&#39;t want to let it go.&quot; Wow, didn&#39;t think he&#39;d take the conversation this way. Well, his thoughts on the elderly&#39;s memories aside, the question naturally went back to him, though he was more than willing to answer her.

&quot;Hmm. Not really. My parents just sort of let me do my own thing once I grew old enough, So Im not really all that close to them and I barely get to visit my grandparents too. I think the last time was when I was 10 or 11. Ive just kinda grew on my own if I just remove my parents from the picture.

Maybe I accidentally copy something she taught me once, I usually just knit whatever is in my head, or just start and see where I go.&quot;

<em>Aiko seemed a bit confused at what Kataoka said about his parents, do parents really just... let their kids be free like that? It&#39;s kind of hard to say if he really was free or just ignored, but the entire concept was alien to her so she probably couldn&#39;t even question the difference in the first place.</em>

&quot;What? That&#39;s... weird. My parents are kind of the opposite, I&#39;m supposed to be an adult and all but... they&#39;re really all over the place when it comes to me. I still have to listen to everything, obey all their rules, it really feels like I never grew up sometimes... and I really wanna be like all the adults and teenagers on TV, ya know?&quot;</span>

&quot;Well, they&#39;re not wrong.

It&#39;s... scary, that&#39;s why I don&#39;t... have a window in my room.&quot;

<em>Aiko started to look down, it was pretty embarrassing to admit she lied about how her room looked, and to have to reveal all those secrets to him. Her parents probably wouldn&#39;t care as long as she didn&#39;t speak badly of it, but how would she know? She&#39;s locked in a skyscraper with a bunch of strangers who have to kill each other.</em>

&quot;I can&#39;t cook, we all eat dinner together, otherwise I have to ask my parents to bring me food. My mom says men today are worth nothing so there&#39;s no point in me learning to cook for a husband, so whenever I make food it&#39;s just... those noodles you find in plastic bags. But it&#39;s not like they&#39;re mean! They&#39;re very nice, and they care about me, it&#39;s just different than parents you see on TV. I sometimes sneak out at night when it&#39;s not a weekend to watch anything but gameshows, so I&#39;d know.&quot;

<em>Her parents sound... backwards, in a weird type of way. Her family definitely isn&#39;t something you see everywhere, anywhere. It&#39;s almost weird how she&#39;s basically completely fine with it.</em></span>

<em>The easiest and clearest conclusion to draw from this is that she&#39;s been basically indoctrinated. Since she&#39;s no sense of what other kids are supposed to be like, she relies on her parents for what that outlook is supposed to be.</em> 

He sighed, a look of pity forming on his face as thoughts beginning to look more like reality than just his assumptions. &quot;Is it like a prison there...? That room of yours without much light from the outside?&quot; His tone had drastically shifted, from his usual one to one expressing sadness. &quot;Do you think its fair what they did to you?&quot; He kept asking her these questions, possibly out of concern for her since she&#39;s being treated like some kind of endangered species.

&quot;Are any of your thoughts about the outside world actually what you genuinely think or are they what your parents stuffed into your head.&quot; This one he was aiming directly at her. Depending on her answer he might take that conclusion differently.</span>

With a bit of hesitation, he pushed through. &quot;Your age has nothing to do with how people are outside. I brought it up because <strong>you&#39;re not acting like your age at all.</strong> Hence why I called you a sheltered child.&quot; He put emphasis on the bolded part in particular. &quot;Your parents can care about you and protect you all they want but what they&#39;re doing is isolating you from the world, one that you&#39;re supposed to live in with everyone else.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re supposed to get hurt. You&#39;re supposed to feel pain. You&#39;re supposed to be heart-broken. All of this accumulate to something we call &#39;life experience&#39;. If you never get hurt, then when will you ever learn to get hurt? Will you be prepared for it?&quot;

&quot;If you&#39;re just living inside of a closed off box, then what can you do? Peer at the world through rose-colored glasses from afar? You&#39;re not discovering anything, nor are you learning anything. You&#39;re just looking at the world through a depiction, not reality.&quot;

He sighed, feeling rather spent from all of this talking. He still had points to get across but he didn&#39;t have the energy to spare to sit properly, so he just plopped back onto his bed. &quot;Look, I don&#39;t know nothing about your parents. All I have to work with is things you&#39;ve told me about them. I might be wrong and they might turn out to be pretty nice people. From what Im hearing from you however, that look does not suit them at all.&quot;</span>

She couldn&#39;t really talk back to him about it, everything he said was a truth she was kept away from under the guise of love and protection. Or perhaps exactly that, but taken in the wrong direction.</em>

&quot;I&#39;m not... a child...&quot; <em>She weakly stuttered, almost unable to speak.</em> &quot;I&#39;m mature, I... I just live differently than people here or the people on TV. I-It&#39;s okay... to be different. I&#39;m just different like everybody else! I... why can&#39;t you just see me as different? S-Shouldn&#39;t friends accept each other for who they are...? I don&#39;t want to be hurt or feel pain, I just... I just want to live with my parents and Natsuzuki, and make pretty clothes for everybody. I don&#39;t want to be here! If I just stayed home I wouldn&#39;t have to deal with any of this!&quot;

<em>She shoved her face into the cat and started to cry for a good few minutes, this was the pain that she was supposed to experience. The realization that everything she had lived through was a means of shutting her off from everybody, but she stopped eventually and looked at Kataoka, taking a deep breath. If she was 18, she had to act like it.</em>

&quot;F-Fine... I&#39;ll try to... o-open up. But... g-give us some time. To think about it and... everything. Is it fine if I... go and sleep for the rest of the day...?&quot; *Apparently still too tired to remember the fact she can&#39;t sleep, it&#39;s hard to just have a habit cancelled like that, even in a killing game. &quot;I-I promise to come back to you tomorrow.&quot;</span>

One where she doesn&#39;t have to get hurt, happily make clothes for people and live with her parents without a care in the world for whatever happens. Unfortunately, her parents and even her grandmother had to live in a world contrary to that while she gets to wallow in this perfect world. It almost felt too sad to make her face such a reality. But eventually she had to. This particular killing game is all of those pains combined. The thought of having to see dead bodies, being betrayed by your closest friends and having to doubt them are all things she would eventually experience.

Hell, if Kataoka didn&#39;t control himself right now, he&#39;d be shedding a few tears. When she calmed down, he rolled off the bed before landing on the floor with a slight thud, a muffled groan coming out of his mouth as soon as he hit the floor. He eventually got up, putting one knee on the floor so he could look at her directly. He plopped one of his hands on top of her head, gently patting it. &quot;Take however long you want, but don&#39;t forget about it, alright? That journey for independence isn&#39;t something you should do on your own, so you can always rely on me and everyone here to help you during those times. So, don&#39;t be scared to reach out alright?&quot; Ignoring the bags under his eyes and the tired look on his face, he still managed to give her a smile to reassure her. &quot;Oh, and you can&#39;t exactly sleep remember? But yeah, you can come back anytime!&quot; He eventually pulls his hand away from her head.</span>

She wasn&#39;t even ready to interact with people, so it was almost a miracle that she managed to actually talk to some of them in the first place. But, like said previously, her hedonistic bubble of living in a locked room with no worries had to be popped, it&#39;s quite a shame that a killing game of all things had to pop it. But she had to be strong, if she showed herself as weak, people could manipulate her, or worse, kill her outright.</em>

&quot;T-Thank you... Kataoka...&quot; <em>She sniffled and wiped her last tears away before she stood up.</em>

&quot;I promise that I won&#39;t take long to think about it! I-I can think of anything when I&#39;m alone with Natsu, and... deciding to open up shouldn&#39;t be too hard when I&#39;m willing to do it, I just... need some time to prepare, that&#39;s all. But I&#39;ve got you and I&#39;ve got him, so... <em>Yaaaawn.</em> it shouldn&#39;t be too bad. Thank you, you&#39;re... you&#39;re a good friend.&quot; 

<em>She walked over to give him a hug, gripping him tightly before finally letting go, it&#39;s okay if she couldn&#39;t sleep, and maybe it was okay that she was scared, because she had to learn to accept her fears if she truly wanted to survive this killing game, and that&#39;s exactly what she will do.</em>

&quot;I promise to be back tomorrow, okay? P-Please... don&#39;t die. I promise I won&#39;t die too! Not when you&#39;re around with me!&quot;

<em>She let him go and shook his hand, this time sticking her hand out of her sleeve before she made way for the door, looking at him one last time before she finally walked off to her dorm.</em>

&quot;L-Let&#39;s go, Natsu... we... we have to be strong. Together.&quot;</span>

As soon as she left, he just flopped onto the floor with his body sprawled. <em>Oh god. Why do I feel so tired now. Gosh, whatd you expect, you talked some sense into her, of course it&#39;d be tiring afterwards.</em>

He stared at the ceiling, a chuckle erupted from his mouth which turned into a brief laugh. <em>Its all worth it.</em></span>

Still, he needed the rest considering how damn near close he was to becoming deranged from sleep deprivation. For now though, he&#39;s all set. Could use some more Zs but he kept thinking about what happened today.

<em>It was unfortunate to just leave him body there. Would be a good idea to properly cover him up so not everyone has to lay eyes on that sorry state.</em>

<em>That&#39;ll have to wait for now.</em> The thought he had before was the possibility of there being another weapon involved in the murder. While it was true that all the evidence had been found, he still wanted to clear out any further possibilities. So he set off to the most likely room, the weapons room.</span>

Oh wait, its just him waking up to the bright light he forgot to turn off yesterday. Yesterday was wack. He met two unfamiliar individuals, most noteworthy of which being Araki. He was a strange fellow and him being an associate of Blake threw up a bunch of red flags but he seemed nice.

For now though, he decided he would take a look at the new locations available to them after the first trial. He got dressed up and exited his dorm.</span>

He shaped a big smile with his fingers, which stayed in a crooked and awkward position before dressing up and heading out to the new locations.</span>

After a few seconds of making sure the coast was clear, she placed a pillow on the floor in front of his door, before laying out a nicely folded sweater on it. It was high quality, a simple blue and white striped sweater, though it did look just a bit too big for him. On top of the sweater there also lay a note:</em>

&quot;Hi, Kataoka. I didn&#39;t want to interrupt you with anything, so I&#39;ll simply leave this here and hope nobody takes it. I wanted to knit you something as a thank you for being a friend, I&#39;m sorry if it&#39;s not pretty or doesn&#39;t fit you. I didn&#39;t really have any of your clothes so I tried to assume what you&#39;d like. I placed it on a pillow so the sweater wouldn&#39;t get dirty from the floor, you can keep it if you want!&quot;

<em>And with that, she knocked on his door if he was inside and walked off to her dorm, hopefully he will like it.</em></span>

He couldn&#39;t of anyone but Aiko considering she would be the only person that would bother visiting his room. <em>Maybe its Manami or Derek... Or maybe eren Rena...</em> That bit of thinking got him distracted before realizing that he was meant to answer the door.

He scrambled out of his bed, his feet getting caught up on his sheets and made him trip face first on the floor. An audible thud was made and a groan of pain followed it shortly as he slowly brought himself off the floor. Bringing a hand to his face and rubbing it lightly, he slowly approached the door before swinging the door open. As he lifted his hand, there was nothing in his immediate vicinity. After a few blinks, he glanced around the hallway, first to the right then to the left, noticing that a door was closing as soon as he looked to his left. He wondered if that was the mysterious visitor that knocked on his door.

Kataoka tilted his head downwards, noticing a sweater neatly placed on top of a pillow. Immediately, he assumed that it was probably Aiko&#39;s handiwork, which made him pick up the sweater almost immediately off the floor. He fiddled around with it in one hand while reading through the note with the other. A tender smile formed with a light rosy tint flushed his cheeks. &quot;That little rascal.. I thought I said <em>after</em>&quot; He breathed a satisfied sigh, folding the note in two and shoving it in his hoodie&#39;s pocket along with Manami&#39;s ring. Before closing the door behind him, he picked up the pillow and dusted it off.</span>

All the tears he had prior were dried up and all thats left now is him being completely overtaken by this incident. He was.. Back to square one. No. Perhaps he was even further back. Back to when he even participated in this killing game.

<em>That&#39;s funny... Never thought Id be back here.

Alone, once more.

As Rena knocked on it, she would notice that the door itself was slowly being pushed open with her knocks. Inside, was a mess of a bedroom. Sheets all over the floor, a book opened face down and the inconspicuous body that obviously belonged to Kataoka. His pillow was drenched and looking up from it he saw a ray of light piercing through the room.

<em>Someone probably entered... Maybe they&#39;re gonna kill me next..</em>

He eagerly awaited for whats to come.</span>

&quot;Oh right... The chess chick... Have you come to kill me as well..?&quot; He asked, his tone neither grim or maniacal. It was just... Empty. There was no feeling to it. A void as empty as the deep reaches of space. Another thing to note is that his way of talking has been.. a bit different so to speak but thats just a matter of fact, considering what happened.

&quot;...If you&#39;re here for anything other than ending my life, then buzz off. I...Don&#39;t want to see anyone right now.&quot; He started off a bit rudely but there were hints of sadness in the last line before he turned to his side, facing the wall.</span>

Admittedly, he doesn&#39;t know her entire personality or make up but he can confidently say that he knows her best due to the time he&#39;s spent bonding with her. The thought of wanting to know more about her made his heart ache. Now that she&#39;s passed, there was no way for that. He can&#39;t get to know the person known as Aiko any longer and he won&#39;t be seeing her grow anymore as well.

Teetering to the edge of sobbing, he responded once more; &quot;...I didn&#39;t get to say thanks.&quot;

&quot;Nor was I able to hang out with her outside of here like I envisioned...Or even make sweaters with her since she said she&#39;d teach me...&quot; He seemed to be getting a lot out despite knowing little about Rena. Maybe an ear was all he needed to at least calm down.</span>

By then, it might seem like Kataoka&#39;s putting up barriers to protect his vulnerable self at the moment. This was definitelt one of, if not, the most lowest point in his life. The concept of loss, especially for someone close to him was completely alien and one he&#39;s never had the misfortune to experience before this killing game.

He feels conflicted on what to feel. Talking to Aiko and hanging out with her became one of the two reasons he has for wanting to live and survive in this killing game. Now that she was gone, he felt unsure about himself. About whether her should comfort himself that he still isnt completely empty handed or not.</span>

Do what you can so that something like this doesn&#39;t happen to other people, so that no one has to go through the pain of having someone precious ripped away from them too soon.&quot; 

Rena hesitated again for a second, contemplating her own words. That was... the only thing they could do for the victims now right? Live on, avenge them, figure out who did things to them... that was it. Rena continued to take another step forward, like she was approaching a cornered animal. 

&quot;And.... avenge her I suppose.&quot;</span>

He didnt respond for a while and he remained motionless all the while. Even his sobs had died completely. He lifted himself up and sat upright, his face still facing the wall. &quot;Why should I exert that effort to other people to begin with...?&quot; He would utter. She might not see it but his face was slowly twisting into an expression filled with irritation. &quot;I&#39;m tired of doing things for people I barely know or even like. That&#39;s such a waste of precious time. The only ones who matter are those closest to me. And most of you guys aren&#39;t even close to that threshold. In fact...&quot;

He turned around, giving her an expression thats never been seen from Kataoka or at least, one that you wouldn&#39;t expect from someone of his character.

&quot;Because of what happened before and today, I&#39;m convinced.&quot;

<strong>&quot;No one here is trustworthy.&quot;</strong></span>

So, Ive come to the decision that I should stop all ties to begin with, starting now.&quot; He went on. &quot;You all may be Ultimates but you&#39;re probably the most human anyone can be. Human nature is just bubbling with activity inside of all of you, even though you&#39;re meant to separate yourselves from the norm.&quot;

&quot;That can be said for anyone who&#39;s put in a life or death situation like this but as it turns out, you&#39;re all nothing special. In the face of this crisis, the immense hope you represent for all the little people that crowd you shatters as you submit to desperation. I even considered rejecting my talent just so I can stop associating myself with you people. In fact, I rejected it before even coming here in the first place. Now, its become a necessity.&quot;

&quot;What made Aiko different was that she was transparent, through and through. Someone I could trust would not succumb to such temptations. She was steadfast on the smaller things and that kept her from becoming a decrepit mess the previous blackened had become. And now she&#39;s ruined. She&#39;s dead.&quot; Once again, tears flowed down his cheeks whenever he even utters that word.

&quot;You Ultimates killed her. One of you Ultimates killed her..!&quot; His facade once known as Kataoka was crumbling before her, revealing whatever this is supposed to be. &quot;One of you stepped on her for your own ends and her life was taken in exchange... You killed the only person I saw as a friend.&quot;</span>

Just because they were Ultimates didn&#39;t mean they were any different from normal humans. Sure, they had a bit of an obsession and a talent for <em>one specific field</em> but that&#39;s all. 

There&#39;s another term for that you know. Monomaniacs. A person who exbhits an obsession for one thing and yet. Yet. Because Ultimates are so <em>glorified</em>, they aren&#39;t treated like the humans they are. Just like how Kataoka is acting. 

...However. Rena can&#39;t disagree that people are selfish. That&#39;s just how humans are. But right now, saying things logically isn&#39;t going to fix anything. Not at all. Even if it&#39;s against what she believes in first she&#39;ll have to fix Kataoka&#39;s own thinking. 

&quot;...Aren&#39;t you assuming things a little too much?&quot; Rena quietly replied, keeping her voice at the same level-tone it&#39;s always been at. &quot;You&#39;re grouping all the Ultimates together as selfish beings. When in reality you know we&#39;re not all like that.&quot;</span>

&quot;Oh. I recall. You all are just so strewn with colorful backgrounds and stories that are so unlike everyone else. Horrible upbringings, priveleged ones, mundane and everything in between. At least, that&#39;s whats shown anyways. I was just looking for a scapegoat.  What I&#39;ll do to the killer once I&#39;ve sniffed them out would be much more than just a simple talkdown.&quot; He looked her down with a steady gaze. Whatever he intends to do with the killer, doesn&#39;t sound very good to say the least.

&quot;I mean, Im not exactly exaggerating either, am I? You&#39;re all on a league of your own. And despite people seeing you as such, its hard for them to see you as normal people, no?&quot;

&quot;Their talents are the pinnacle of their lifestyle. Mine isn&#39;t so much, considering people only label me as one after what I did a few years back.&quot; Finally, he felt like talking about himself. &quot;I don&#39;t despise any of you per say outside of the killing game. But I loathe what you represent. Because your mere presence shakes the very foundation of a carefully crafted system.&quot;</span>

&quot;A league of our own? I wonder....&quot; Rena shrugged, &quot;We&#39;re still people. Even if the others don&#39;t see that quite easily.&quot; This conversation has shifted it&#39;s focus and Rena&#39;s not sure what to think about that. 

&quot;And what system would that be?&quot; She sighed a bit, &quot;People are unique. There&#39;s always going to be those that are better at things than others.

The vast majority that leeches off the the face of this earth are borderline uninteresting. Especially in Japan. Where all is conformed to one single mold and should you derail from it, you&#39;re out of the loop. The small pieces of the minority are people such as yourself and those who do possess a kind of uniqueness. Unfortunately, they can&#39;t spread their wings as freely as you do and are forced to abide to that mold. They&#39;re dictated by the actions of others despite having their own characters.&quot;


&quot;You all represent individualism. A sense of being your own person. What you have is a privelege that not many people enjoy. That&#39;s why you&#39;re unique and why everyone else is streamlined. The reason why you&#39;re held as objects of admiration is because you have something everyome else doesn&#39;t have. And that makes your position all the more valuable.&quot; He explained in great lengths regarding his own views on the matter, almost seeemingly forgotten about what happened today. Though, it&#39;s still in his mind that&#39;s for sure. From what he&#39;s explained so far, this might be the very system he refers to.

&quot;Its funny, isn&#39;t it. You&#39;re just doing the things you love and all of a sudden, you&#39;re the best at what you do. And people either hail you for it or want to drag you across the dirt for having such talent.&quot;</span>

&quot;You&#39;re right. People <em>do</em> glorify ultimates because of their talents. That was bound to happen. It&#39;s like with any sort of celebrity or politician or anyone with a semblance of influence and power over the general public. Or even outside of that, there are those that people look up to and respect others simply because of how they act.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t think getting respected, getting fame is anything that&#39;ll change- there are those outside of being an Ultimate that still get glorified.&quot; Maybe not in <em>Japan</em> necessarily, but still. 

&quot;That. Doesn&#39;t mean that we&#39;re any less human though.&quot;</span>

Something like this... debating certain points or just talking about the flaws of society is defintely more her speed then something... emotional. She does nod a bit though, showing that she did agree. &quot;I... wish that too. Although it&#39;s not exactly the more realistic wish.&quot; 

Seeing the slightest hint of a smile and Kataoka relaxing a bit, Rena relaxes herself too. &quot;Well stigmas in general are quite- limiting in my opinion so I&#39;m... glad.&quot; But her look does turn the slightest bit more sorrowful at the mention of Aiko. 

&quot;Ah don&#39;t mention it.&quot; She shook her head the slightest bit. &quot;Like I said- we all have to look out for each other here and...&quot; Rena quickly thought back to her promise with Aiko. &quot;I owed her this much at least.&quot;</span>

But regarding the latest bit... 

If Rena was surprised she didn&#39;t show it. She... honestly had her doubts about someone forgetting their talent. Now the only question is why did Flemming choose to cover it up as well? ...Not the time though. She can question these things later. 

&quot;...I&#39;ll be honest, I had figured. And- I understand why you would do so. Considering that this place was strange and... everything it makes sense. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s something you have to apologize for.&quot; She sighed a bit, &quot;And... if it&#39;s exhausting... I wouldn&#39;t want to force you but- I don&#39;t spill information easily.&quot;</span>

&quot;Well. I didn&#39;t intend on apologizing for it in the first place. Its just for the sake of formalities, I suppose. Plus being really nice and kind to everyone unconditionally really isn&#39;t my style.&quot;

&quot;Its <strong>Mitsuo.</strong> <strong>Mitsuo Hideyoshi.</strong> As for my Ultimate, Im what people refer to as the <strong>Ultimate Ghostwriter.</strong>&quot;

Ah. Finally. A weight off his chest. He can finally act like himself. No more of that Kataoka nonsense. Still, it did feel like he was abandoning the times he&#39;s spent with Aiko but in all honesty, He managed to mingle in his true feelings through the medium of his caricature. Now, he was just leaving his shell. It was at that moment he realized that Rena didn&#39;t actually ask for it so, he got flustered and tried to save face. &quot;I-In case you&#39;re asking, of c-course..&quot;</span>

&quot;Pleasure to make your acquaintance as well, Rena.&quot; It was like re-introducing himself to everyone once again. Its gonna be a hassle to explain it to everyone once the profiles are shifted to match his revelation. Well, a thought for another day.

&quot;Oh yeah. You did mention that. Well, I guess I held up on that promise at least.&quot; Another word that triggered a recall of Aiko&#39;s death. He tried to restrain any of his facial muscles to contort to the imagery flashing through his head since Rena was around. Though, on the outside, it just looked like his eyes were twitching. Not exactly a red flag but would look peculiar to Rena nonetheless.

&quot;To be honest, I didn&#39;t even know I had an affinity for it. But a twist of fate and the person at the end of the threat showed me what I could do. So, I guess here I am, thanks to her.&quot; As his mind wandered off to the time he spent with &#39;this person&#39;, a smile lingering with nostalgia form on his face. Speaking of, he didn&#39;t really get much out of Rena so he figured he might as well ask.

&quot;What about you? How&#39;d you come across your talent..?&quot;</span>

&quot;Hm. We have similar stories then. I just- had the game taught to me by my father and then just... I really liked it? A little too much maybe and I just... played constantly.&quot; She shrugged a bit. &quot;And when you play something that much you&#39;re just bound to be decent at it.&quot;</span>

Then, he went over to the table, closed the notebook and seamlessly put it away inside one of the drawers before pulling out another drawer, rummaging through it even though it was mostly empty.

He emerges with a chess set that appeared in his room this one day. He held it up while that one zelda music plays in the background. Not like he could hear it though. He returned to Rena with the set in hand, &quot;I had this a while ago and Ive been meaning to bring it to you. So, how about a game after the trial?&quot; He seemed...hopeful, at most. He was still burdened by that sense of loss but he wasn&#39;t about to make the conversation flow awkwardly because he felt down. Its how he did it with Mayumi and its how he intends to do it with Rena as well.</span>

&quot;Oh. Speaking of,--&quot; He hopped off of his bed, taking that one sheet and tidying up his bed afterwards. Then, he went over to the table, closed the notebook and seamlessly put it away inside one of the drawers before pulling out another drawer, rummaging through it even though it was mostly empty.

He emerges with a chess set that appeared in his room this one day. He held it up while that one zelda music plays in the background. Not like he could hear it though. He returned to Rena with the set in hand, &quot;I had this a while ago and Ive been meaning to bring it to you. So, how about a game after the trial?&quot; He seemed...hopeful, at most. He was still burdened by that sense of loss but he wasn&#39;t about to make the conversation flow awkwardly because he felt down. Its how he did it with Mayumi and its how he intends to do it with Rena as well.                    </span>

He paused, his eyes noticing that alarming detail almost immediately. Now he felt like he didnt need to read this but against his better judgement, as well as a sigh that followed afterwards, he reluctantly opened it.</span>

Without even a second read, he ripped the paper in half with such vigor and pushed away all notions of friendships from Araki. To settle it further, he ripped it to even smaller pieces to get his point across.

&quot;Friend? After that fiasco..? I don&#39;t fucking think so.&quot;

With yet another sigh, he retired to his bed, probably wanting to rest for the day before he could properly face people.</span>

Still, he tries to be on the lookout for anything that might be eye-catching.

Anyways, off he goes with Aiko&#39;s handmade sweater as his apparel for the day.</span>

&#39;...Where...am I...?&#39;

It was...Dark. Opening or closing his eyes made no difference. Looking around made no difference. Everything around him was utterly covered in this pitch-black darkness where not even a single ray of light penetrated through. The only sensation available to him was the fact that his feet were not touching the ground, no matter how much he flailed, his legs would never reach a surface that he could use as a foothold. Thus, he continued falling, slowly. A feeling akin to sinking further down into the ocean. Eventually, his body lightly made contact with a surface of some kind. His sense of touch informed his brain of the flat surface he was laying on, something you wouldnt expect from an ocean floor of any kind. Even then, he didn&#39;t seem to be affected by anything thats characteristically like a body of water. There was no pressure pushing against him. His eyes doesnt sting whenever he opens them and his ears are seemingly unaffected. Just the sensation. If he tried hard enough, he could try and swim up but for some reason, he didn&#39;t feel the need to. And even if he really tried, where was up..? His sense of direction wasn&#39;t very acute, even though he has all the necessary details.</span>

Next thing, he knew, he was standing...? Upright, too. Even though he was laying down just a moment ago. Without any control over his body, his legs compelled itself to start walking. That heaviness where he fought against the currents of the water was gone and no matter how much he wanted to plant his feet on the ground and stop moving, his legs kept taking strides forward. Aside from his thoughts, he had no control over any part of his body, as if he was in the back seat of a car watching it all happen from behind. Then, light illuminated his field of view, temporarily blinding him. When his eyes got used to it, he noticed that he put his hands up in front of his face in response to that bright flash and when he tried to move them, he was fully capable of doing so. Small bits of movements were made with his two hands, as if to confirm if he fully held control over his own body and as soon as he looked up, a figure came into view.

It was familiar. Of course, it was familiar. It was Aiko. Her petite stature was acompanied by the sweet smile she would project his way every time they talked. Her sleep-deprived face did not hinder the brightness she displayed towards him and it was captivating towards the young man. So much so that he took a few strides towards her, which in response, she turned around and walked the opposite direction. Whenever he quickened his pace, she follows. Whenever he picked up his feet and ran after her, she follows. No matter how fast he ran, or how much he tried to reach her with his hands, he never did. Eventually, she stopped. A look of relief cracked on his once hopeless face but the closer he got to her, the more violently the white light that was illuminating where he was in flickered. As he grabs hold of her shoulder, the light blinked once and once it returned, his hands grapsed nothing before he tried to catch himself from falling, almost barely.</span>

He was..confused. That one brief look of relief he had prior twisted into one full of fear. He glanced around for any signs of her, his face ever so slightly turning sour the more he scowered until eventually, he turned his back. He bore witness to the horrors he saw back then. Aiko&#39;s corpse exactly as presented when she was discovered. A puddle formed beneath her stiff body, the drops of blood coming from her slit neck trinkled, each drop reverberating throughout the room and his brain. His expression was in utter disbelief, his lips shuddered as his pupils constricted and shook violently. His teeth chattered as he took a few steps back before bumping into... something.</span>

His whole body shivered in response and he quickly turned around. There, he sees Rena, in all of her glory. Her stance contrary to the lightly slouching Aiko and a front that was as steadfast as his, her face also projected the faintest form of a smile towards him. A smile that he recalled she gave a while back. Again, he took his strides, starting much faster this time. His pace quickened, and so did hers. His body ran as fast as he could, yet she did not. No matter how hard he tried, he could never reach her. He was about to say something, the words instead projecting itself in the very front of his mind as if a picture was flashed across.

&quot;...Wait...&quot;

&quot;...Wai...t..!&quot;

&quot;...WAIT!!...&quot;

The writing was horrid, akin to a child&#39;s scribbles with a tinge of insanity. The first time, he noticed that she was losing speed. The second, she was walking at a snail&#39;s pace. The third, she had frozen in place. With each one, the letters and writing itself became more and more chaotic. And accompanying it all, that same flickering as he got closer to Rena. Once he grabbed hold of her shoulder, the light blinked and what he grabbed was no more. Rena&#39;s body split in half abruptly, in a fact similar to how she was executed. It was almost instantaneous, sprays of blood getting on him as he stumbled past each of her halves. By then, he was so distraught that he forgot to catch himself this time. He allows himself to skid across the floor without an attempt at breaking his fall. His arm still outstretched, still trying to reach for something. He wasnt fazed by the fall. It didnt even look like he was affected by the pain at all. All he had was this blank expression, light failing to even relfect in his eyes and his mouth slightly open, visibly shaking.</span>

The now broken boy slowly raised himself off the ground, his body slouched forward with both of his hands hanging. His head turned to his right, in the distance was another figure he recognized. It was his long sought after Mayumi. Only one thought occurred to him. And that one thought drove him to catch up to her.

He broke off into a dash, the bits of life slowly clinging onto him and forming on his once lifeless expression. A single tear was shed as he reached his arm out to her, uttering a few words...

&#39;...Please don&#39;t go too...&#39;</span>

His eyes opened with one loud gasp following. His right hand was lifted upwards, in a similar manner as how he tried to reach out to the ones from before. The hand was brought closer to his face, where he faced his flat palm. It was shaking. Mitsuo placed the palm onto his face before shifting his body to lean against his bed&#39;s frame. He took several deep breaths, presumably  to calm himself down.

&quot;...First Aiko... Now Rena... Who... else...?&quot; His palm trailed slightly upwards into his hair before tugging on it tightly. 

&quot;No more... No more...&quot;

Mitsuo brought his legs closer to his chest and curled up into a ball. He buried his face into it, where only his sobs were any indication of what sort of face he was making at that moment.</span>
