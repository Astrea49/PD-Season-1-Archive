She had no ideas for fancy meals to summon, the TV in the rec room was broken, and there were no knitting supplies she could find. It was safe to say that her stay during this killing game was painfully boring, maybe even that is an understatement.

But there had to be something around here, right? There were multiple people in this odd skyscraper with her, and they had to find some entertainment somewhere, and for that exact reason Aiko decided she will once again, heroically attempt to explore this skyscraper to find something, ANYTHING to do.</em>

&quot;Come on, Natsu. We need to find some... uh... I&#39;ll even take a toy at this point, honestly.&quot;</span>

Initially, she planned to simply stay in her dorm the whole time, but the boredom of having absolutely not a single thing to do and not a single visitor was really starting to dig into her, so she decided maybe she could raise her mood over a meal, then quickly come back to the dorm to save energy.

And so, she headed out to the food court.</em></span>

Once everything was no longer in disarray, he looked back at Aiko. &quot;And that&#39;s how you properly tidy up your bed.&quot; He smiled at her as he said so. Perhaps he was showing this so that she could do it properly next time. Of course, he didn&#39;t mistake her for a child or anything but he still felt the need to show it to her. Once he was done, he sat on the edge of her bed, patting the spot to his side as if gesturing her to sit next to him. If that wasn&#39;t apparent enough, he even said it, &quot;Cmere.

Who knows, you might not have known how to tidy up a bed&quot; That one cheeky smile he uses gives her when hes teasing her was in full view once again, a slight giggle coming afterwards. He noticed that she had shuffled away from him when she sat down. Kataoka was slightly confused as to why that was but he just lets it slide, no reason to call her out on that after all.

&quot;Yeah, I understand. If thats how you want to go about treating your friends, then Ill respect it. Its very kind of you as well.&quot; <em>Right, I did say she could make herself at home when she first came to my room. Perhaps she&#39;s just extending the same level of hospitality...</em>

Once he got a closer look at her face, he noticed a detail he might&#39;ve overlooked. Her cheeks were a bit glossy, as if stained with tears and her eyes looked slightly wet. &quot;Hey, your eyes are a bit damp.&quot; He drew his hand back into his sleeve and brought it over to her face, wiping her leftover tears away.

&quot;There we go. Are you sure you weren&#39;t bawling your eyes out while I wasn&#39;t looking?&quot; He said, wearing a concerned look on his face.</span>

<em>She tried to pull away when he wiped her tears, but she didn&#39;t really have anywhere to go except off the bed and towards him, so she simply had to accept it and hope he wouldn&#39;t point out that she was crying, which he of course did, which made her look down and sigh.</em>

&quot;I don&#39;t know the exact reason you cried but its still fine to cry, no? So, there&#39;s really no need to hide it.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Seeing her constantly having to find her ground and adjust to the conversation was rather interesting for him. It was like her trying to gain her own views while still juggling the things she&#39;s learnt throughout her life as reference. Well, this was what he had hoped for and though they&#39;re just dramatic and overly exaggerated, its still a good place to start, better than having no idea hoe people work.

All he had to do now was just fine-tune it, occasionally just letting her figure it out on her own and be there to support her in case she needs help. Such as this instance, &quot;Well, thats just typical drama. They tend to abuse tropes and certain traits to make the drama more enjoyable, or as dumb people would call it, &#39;realistic&#39;.&quot; He seemed to have a bit of a pet peeve with this subject since its clear in his tone and delivery. &quot;Theres lots of lies that people use. Most are more blatant, others are just very manipulative and often twists the truth. There&#39;s also big and small, subtle and apparent, so on and so forth.&quot;

<em>Her too, huh.. Im not used to it either, especially not one in that fashion.</em> He tried to push it down because hearing her say that was exactly why he came in the first place. &quot;Now you know. We can never know who this might happen to or even when it might happen. People tend to break in times of desperation and this time, it was Kyo. It was scary for me as well. Even for other people too. But I guess you could say that&#39;s normal. Its normal to be afraid like that.&quot; He tried to sympathize with her.

&quot;We tend to think &#39;what if that was me&#39; whenever we witness something like that but I believe that so long as we have the willpower and a drive to keep moving forward, I think we&#39;ll do just fine.&quot; He ended it on a light note to cheer her up and make her think positivelt even after that.</span>

<em>It was noticably hard for her to speak, even if it was just a sign of her opening up and thinking of herself, she was much more calm and comfortable whenever she had played her emotionless act, apparently this is what Aiko actually was behind her mask, but she will probably become more comfortable with acting more like herself around Kataoka, not around others though, not yet. She doesn&#39;t know the others.</em>

&quot;Yeah, I know that we couldn&#39;t sleep and that we had to kill and all but... Devon wasn&#39;t killed brutally, right? He was just hit with a stick and that&#39;s that! But... well, I don&#39;t know what happened to Kyo because I covered my eyes but... I heard all the screams and machine sounds and everything and... I think I&#39;m gonna be sick just thinking about it...&quot;

<em>Her face turned pale as she leaned against the wall, the thought of thinking about what could have happened to Kyo actually did made her sick.</em>

&quot;I don&#39;t want to think about it being me... n-not that I would ever kill someone, I&#39;m too weak and scared to do that so even if I wanted I couldn&#39;t. But...

The characters they portray are still meant to be people after all. But if it was just the every day life, without stimulus and without anything happening, would anyone still be watching? Hence why, they add &#39;enticing&#39; events and characters that orchestrate that to spice up the story. A slice of life is but a portrayal of real life but in reality, most of us dont lead that sort of lifestyle on the regular. We all walk different paths in life and its not without its trials and tribulations. But unlike the people on TV, it doesn&#39;t happen all at once in an episodic format. We realize them later in our lives and some of them might even be resolved rather easily too. Its just, mundane.&quot; You could really hear the quotation marks when he makes them and he&#39;s rambled on this particular point the longest and he still has something to say.

&quot;You Ultimates are more...different. Your own individual lives can all be feasibly made into their own dramas or just stories in general.&quot;

He then listened on about her still relying on either him or her parents but... Natsuzuki was missing from the picture? She often brings up Natsuzuki when it comes to these kinds of things so it was odd to see her not doing so. Regardless, that one theme is still prevalent in her being. 

&#39;Dependency.&#39;</span>

She seems to like relying on others a lot and depending on them. He gets that in a way, wanting to have a second opinion or wanting someone to reaffirm your way of thinking. Though, some eventually are capable of their own thoughts without looking to infer to people too often and he wishes for her to be able to do so as well in the future. Because who knows? He might be taken away too soon before she could do it herself and her parents might no longer be residents of this world. If that were to happen, who does she go to..? Just thinking about it that way breaks his heart and he prays that she doesn&#39;t have to go through such a painful thing. This also mean&#39;t that she had to be friends with those around her as well because if its just him helping her then he&#39;s not too different from her parents. He&#39;d prefer it if the vibrant personalities of people here to rub off of her and help her grow without relying on him all too much. Alas, thats an idea for later. Whether she attempts to do so or not, he will see.

When he heard her describing Devona death, all he could do was wear a frown. &quot;I think its better if you don&#39;t know what happened to Kyo. He&#39;s..&quot; He left it midsentence, unwilling to continue it.

&quot;Im not trying to say you will, but everyone here has a good chance of becoming either the hunter or the hunted. So we have to be careful where we plant our feet.&quot; He clarified, to iron out any wrinkles his previous statement had.

&quot;Well, this is quite the unusual situation we find ourselves in. So, everyday life would not be that bad. In fact, you could say this is one of its heights. A peak that rarely anyone comes across. But at the same time, you can still experience the various pains of life here as well when we spend time with the people here. You&#39;ll see what I mean.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Well, yeah, I know that it&#39;s not real, my parents told me about that everything. But... have you ever thought if... people are real? You know, what if... we&#39;re all actors in our own TV shows? That&#39;s what some people feel like sometimes, we sometimes have guests over at our house but I never got to see them, I only hear them talking with my parents. It&#39;s just weird to meet everybody else I guess, but at least... a-at least people aren&#39;t as bad as I was told. I mean... we did have a murderer among us and everything but... it wasn&#39;t you or Derek so that&#39;s good! It&#39;s good to know that I&#39;m making the right friends, and it makes Natsuzuki happy too.&quot;

<em>Aiko tilted her head in confusion at one of the statements, Ultimate. Yes, she was one and she did acknowledge it, but she wasn&#39;t really able to know what a regular person was like, even if her parents could be considered like that.</em>

&quot;I don&#39;t really want to be a story, to be honest... I just want to be with Natsuzuki, my mom and dad, and, well, with you since recently. That&#39;s why most of my customers don&#39;t actually know me... they just know me by my talent, but not my name. How would you feel if you were an Ultimate, Kataoka? Would you rub it in people&#39;s faces or would you just... be quiet about it, I guess. You have to be an Ultimate, right? If we all are, then I don&#39;t think Blake would have gathered all of us and a random person for no reason. N-Not that you are a r-random person...&quot;

<em>Aiko went over to her cat and picked him up before coming back to the bed, setting him in the middle, between the two of them. She looked the cat in the eyes and pat him before looking back at Kataoka.</em>

&quot;You two should... try to become friends someday. Natsuzuki is very nice and... he&#39;s a bit more open-minded than me, j-just don&#39;t be a better friend than me for him, okay? I... I don&#39;t want to lose him, he&#39;s very, very important to me. He can help me get through any pain, because... that&#39;s what best friends are for, right?&quot;</span>

Shes growing up so fast.</em> He felt like his heart squeezed just looking at this, definitely feeling like a parent of some sort proud of their childs accomplishments.

That aside hearing her talk about her situation at home was almost quite sad to hear. <em>She was like a ghost, huh... I could say the same for myself too.</em> He thought to himself before answering her question. &quot;I&#39;d definitely rub it in your face and everyone&#39;s faces so that I can say, &#39;Im not a normal person, but an Ultimate&#39; &quot; He extended his hand, shaking it and gesturing it as he described, sticking his tongue out a little as he did so. &quot;Well, for one thing, I don&#39;t know how Id react if I am actually talented at something. Ive been such a normal guy all my life and suddenly, Im handed that sort of title. Perhaps I <em>would</em> stay quiet about it. Or perhaps, Ill just act indifferent. Thats a choice too.&quot; Yeah, perhaps he was an Ultimate Something but at this point he&#39;s so used to the way he&#39;s lived his life its better if he just didnt bother with it.

He looked at Natsuzuki, befalling him with sorrowful eyes. <em>I wonder what kind of role he serves for her. Perhaps a coping mechanism. Maybe even her inside voice, one that she&#39;s reluctant to let out because of her situation so she uses a different substance to act as exactly that. Whatever it is, she might have to leave it soon.</em> The look didnt last very long and very quickly he reverted back to a smile. &quot;I thought we were already friends~, right Mr. Natsuzuki??&quot; He pointed it out proudly.</span>

Knitting isn&#39;t really something people are into a lot, I-I think... Usually on TV it&#39;s mostly just old ladies who do that kind of stuff, so it&#39;s not like my talent is very special. But even if your talent is something small, it&#39;s... still a talent, right? Even if it&#39;s something like marathon TV watching or pouring water into a glass... those are pretty... d-dumb, aren&#39;t they?&quot;

<em>She looked down with a slight giggle, looks like even a sheltered girl like her was able to laugh at her own irony and poor jokes. Her head was slowly turning all over the place at this point, thinking about where she would be right now if they hadn&#39;t met at the cinema, while trying to focus on the conversation at hand. Some inner voices were still telling her that just sitting in her bubble would be a better fate, a less painful one, and as tempting as those voices were, she was able to resist them... for now.</em>

<em>Aiko looked over at her cat once he asked the question, just as always, it simply stood there, the cat wasn&#39;t secretly alive or infused with some magical energy, it was as normal as any stuffed toy, aside from the fact that it looked a lot older and rugged compared to anything you&#39;d find at a toy store.</em>

&quot;N-Natsuzuki says yes, but... h-he also says he likes me better still. So... h-he wants to sit with me right now.&quot; <em>She stuttered, almost possessively pulling the cat to her side, she couldn&#39;t let him go even for a friend.</em></span>

It may not be grand or impressive but its still a talent and a title that he&#39;s earned, whatever it is anyways. Though, he prefers to stay indifferent towards whatever potential talent he might have, he still very much appreciates her attempts of cheering him up. Maybe, soon enough, people would be able to rely on her more. Ah yes, hopes for the future. &quot;Thanks, Aiko, thats very kind of you to say.&quot;

Even if its not the way he sees it, he still hopes that she can mold her own person with the experiences she&#39;s gained here. To be frank, it could be said that being here was both a blessing and a curse of sorts for her. Sure, its unfortunate that she has to go through all of this but it also allowed her to mature on her own. Though, he  worries that all that effort she would cull might prove meaningless if they ever return to their normal lives. After all, her parents still have a firm grip around her and there&#39;s no telling if she would be able to defy them when the time comes. Alas, he could only pray and hope for the best as now was the time to nurture their friendship.

&quot;Well, Natsuzuki can have <em>two</em> best friends, y&#39;know~? And it applies to people to. The term best friend is a bit butchered from its original meaning, considering some people just have lots of best friends but I, for one, don&#39;t mind it. Its rather convenient.&quot; Well, a convenient way to not make people feel left out that is.</span>

&quot;I-Is it? I... I just say what I think... that&#39;s all, is speaking your mind like that... kind? I never knew, I&#39;m gonna have to write that down as a note somewhere.&quot;

<em>Even if her parents might not accept Aiko getting more independent, she was definitely going to try her best to exert her free will more. She got to learn that she is a person and that she cannot simply be caged up all her life and hope that nothing bad will come to her, she&#39;s somewhat ready to face the pain and hardships of the real world, though it&#39;s hard to say if she will crawl back into her comfort zone if it ever becomes too much for her.

&quot;N-No he can&#39;t! He&#39;s my best friend!&quot; <em>Aiko shouted almost aggressively, before looking down and slowly shoving the cat towards the middle again.</em> &quot;I-I&#39;m sorry...

It was clear that it was obviously more of the former but he wanted to see how she would react. Eventually, once he got his fill, he said the magic word; &quot;Of course, Im only joking~. I understand how you feel, to an extent and I know how much you want to keep Mr. Natsuzuki all to yourself~&quot; He teased her a bit as he would normally. He was kind of glad that she was very open to jokes and teasing. Otherwise, conversations would&#39;ve been rather dull.

Now, back to her original question. &quot;Well, being blunt and speaking ones mind is a confusing can of worms. Some people tend to deem that saying too much of your mind is bad because you might come across as someone who holds no regard for other people&#39;s feelings. And so, Ms. Aiko, what should one do in this situation to avoid such a thing happen?&quot; He directed the question to her as if she was a random student that got the finger and had to answer the teachers question. He wanted to see how she would face that kind of situation before giving his own thoughts on dealing it.</span>

Afterwards, he tapped the bridge of his nose as if he was pushing up a pair of non-existent glasses. &quot;The answer is, we have to read the situation and the people around us and figure out if its appropriate or not. Usually, you can tell by just being in a place full of people, what kind of &#39;atmosphere&#39; or ambirnce is present in a room and you can read how people feel at a given time by reading their expression or body language or perhaps even a gut feeling or your instincts. After that, you deem whether or not your piece of mind is suitable for this situation or not.&quot; It might have sounded like word garble to her but he still gave that long-winded explanation without stumbling.

&quot;It sounds really hard but once you get used to people around you, you can pull that off pretty easily.&quot; He added.

&quot;I see I see. Do you feel a spiritual connection with him? And what do you mean different? Oh, and didn&#39;t you call him a cat before? You were really insistent on that difference so I thought Id point it out.&quot; He basically bombarded her with questions regarding her and Natsuzuki.</span>

<em>She started sliding in Kataoka and Natsuzuki&#39;s direction, pulling him in close before she heard him ask about the cat.</em>

&quot;H-Huuh? Spiritual connection? I... N-No... I don&#39;t. He is a cat but... he&#39;s special, you know? He can talk to me, but only I can understand him. Back then I could only hear him when mom and dad said his words, but eventually I also learned to hear him and talk to him. He&#39;s like... magical! And that&#39;s why I love him. He&#39;s my own magical friend who loves me~&quot;</span>

&quot;That sounds like a wonderful idea.&quot; He smiled at her suggestion. &quot;And yes, I think there will be an end to this killing nonsense. When is a bit blurry but the fact of the matter is that it will end.&quot; <em>And I look forward to see it ending with everyone here.</em> He thought to himself.

Back to Natsuzuki, &quot;Thats kind of what I was talking about. You feel some sort of connection with him, no? You could alternatively think of it as &#39;love at first sight&#39; too.&quot; When she added that comment about her parents, he was taken aback for a few moments but it wasn&#39;t visible for Aiko to see. <em>Perhaps I read that wrong as well. Maybe its not her subconscious but maybe...</em> He left it hanging, letting the thought marinate now would hinder their conversation, so it was kept for later.

&quot;Did your parents bought him for you? And do you think there are others like him?&quot;</span>

Of course, the poor girl sadly didn&#39;t know that another murder would take place, and another, and another, and so on until the killing game finally ends, but she isn&#39;t too concerned with that right now, surely nobody else could die since the whole sleeping thing is gone!</em>

&quot;Well... I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s really a connection, maybe... my parents stopped understanding him once I finally was able to hear him, only sometimes were they able to really speak with his voice. But I heard him say different things so it was... a bit weird, maybe he says different things to them?&quot; <em>Aiko looked at the cat and placed a finger on her chin, she was... confused. As if the cat didn&#39;t seem to talk to her this time, but it wasn&#39;t something that never happened.</em>

&quot;Yeah, my mom bought him for me. She told me she saw a pretty cat at a store and decided it&#39;s time for me to have a toy for once. My parents always say that toys today are just too flashy and meant to addict kids, so I didn&#39;t really have much to play with before.&quot;

<em>Others like him? Can other toys talk?</em> &quot;Hm... maybe, I never really had anything else, and I never played with anybody else&#39;s toys, so perhaps... perhaps other people&#39;s stuff can talk to them too.

Hearing her describe how her parents thought of toys nowadays made him picture them as &#39;those&#39; kinds of parents. They definitely have a lot of negative opinions about the world, particularly people. They seemed traditional in a way, which led him to think what kind of household was she living in exactly. Questions for later.

&quot;Well, I used to talk to mine a lot when I was a kid but they didn&#39;t say anything back, nor did my parents do that for me. So, I kinda just grew out of it when i got a bit older since I made lots of friends my age in my neighbourhood.&quot; Just looking back on it made him feel a bit of nostalgia and.. A bit sadness as well. He had that nostalgic smile on his face, with crinkles of sadness somewhat apparent on his face as well.</span>

&quot;Awww, it&#39;s okay. When we get out of here, I promise I&#39;ll sell some nice sweaters and buy you some nice toys with the money, ones that can talk too!

He was a bit surprised when she pat him in the back, which made him realize what face he was making and he immediately tried to cover it up. &quot;W-Well, we wouldn&#39;t want Natsuzuki asking you who the toy is for, right? He might see you as unfaithful~&quot; He jests, more of his teasing innuendos. He didn&#39;t mind that she sounded like a child because again, it seemed like it was her idea of cheering people up. &quot;Nothing can beat Natsuzuki though, so I think I&#39;ll just stick to him for now. Having one talking toy is already plenty.&quot; He then leaned back with his hands holding him up. He pondered over what time it was since he lost track after talking for so long with Aiko. Perhaps now was a good note to end it on.

He sat back up a few moments later, his head turning towards Aiko. &quot;I think Ill head off for now, its been good talking to you!&quot; He awaited for a response before he got up.</span>

<em>First is a sweater.</em> &quot;Aiko lived in a rather protective household, living in a room with no windows and a single door. There was nothing special that required this, but her parents thought the outside world may corrupt her in a fashion. Regardless, she did manage to talk to a few people, mainly her grandmother. Her grandmother was knitting a sweater when Aiko became curious and asked for a few lessons. The rest, they say, is history.&quot;

<em>Next (and last) is a stuffed cat. The stuffed cat, or at least a replica of it.</em> &quot;Aiko carries a stuffed cat wherever she goes... if she were to lose it, she would turn turn discomforted and anxious.&quot;

<em>Finally, there is a portrait of her, similar to the portraits of the dead that appear in class trials, except not bound to a long pole. In terms of what was used here to mark her off, two... religious crosses were used.

You cannot move or do anything with these items. They are bound to where they are.</em></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The slight creaking of the door filled the once-vacant room with the presence with a bit of life, a silhouette&#39;s presence greeting the room. Specifically, it was Mitsuo, who once went by the name, Kataoka. A sorrowful look plagued his face, although it seems he entered here with a sense of purpose. He took a few steps inside, one at a time and each of them unveiling an interaction he once had with Aiko.

He stood in the middle of it all, familiar items placed inside and ones he only took one glance of. Well, all except for her stuffed cat. He went over to where it was placed, placing his hand on Natsuzuki&#39;s head, reminding him of the number of times he&#39;s pat her head as a sign of recognition. A bittersweet smile erected itself upon the edges of his lips as he reminisced that detail.

He slowly took his hand off of the cat&#39;s head and walked over to her portrait, her face crossed out by two crosses. He stood there, towering over it at first before kneeling down to its height. &quot;You&#39;ve gotten much shorter since I last saw you huh...&quot; He joked, albeit in rather bad taste. It was his idea of trying to lighten himself up, or at least its one way to interpret it. Kneeling down and just talking to her for a bit didn&#39;t seem practical nor did he have the energy to keep that repetitive position so he got comfortable and sat down cross-legged.

&quot;First of all. Im...really sorry. For lying to you. You were definitely one of the only people here I could trust and that little thing I wanted to tell you...&quot;

&quot;It had something to do with my identity. I wasn&#39;t the...cheery guy you got to know nor was I very kind to people. I was... quite the opposite. But it was thanks to that that I got to know you. I got closer to you, all thanks to my facade and I never would&#39;ve thought that I&#39;d be grateful towards my fake persona of all things.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;I would&#39;ve preferred to tell you this in person. I even left a note in case I died unexpectedly and... I kind of regret not telling you sooner. Cause now you&#39;re off to a faraway place. One I can&#39;t reach at the moment.&quot;﻿

&quot;Second, I&#39;m...sorry for being unable to keep my end of the promise. I promised that Id keep you alive so long as I was here and yet... Here we are...&quot; He hung his head down, a feeling of remorse creeping up to him with its tendrils digging deep into him. However, he&#39;s succumbed to that for long enough.﻿

&quot;I will, however, hold one promise that I made to you. That being, staying alive and seeing the conclusion of this killing game. Although, I really would&#39;ve preferred if I could see it together with you...&quot;

&quot;Ah, jeez. Look at me being all negative... Its usually my style to be the pessimist but I think that&#39;ll change overtime. All thanks to you, you could say.&quot;

&quot;Thank you. Thank you for being... You. And providing me a sense of friendship I never knew I needed. Despite me throwing away every notion of it during my early life, you managed to pull me back into it.&quot;

&quot;Thank you. For being my friend. And for now, I&#39;ll see you later.&quot; As he said so, he pulled out a folded piece of paper, leaning it against her portrait. A soft yet trembling smile formed, one that was bittersweet in nature and one that was meant to be a farewell to his deceased friend. Once he&#39;s said all he could, he stood up, turned his back and left the room with a sense of closure.</span>
